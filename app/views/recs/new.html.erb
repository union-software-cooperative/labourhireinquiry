      We’re continuing to see allegations of the misuse and abuse of workers engaged by rogue labour hire companies. This inquiry will address how the labour hire industry can be better regulated, and how the rights of these workers can be better protected.

      Most Victorian employers, from farmers to small business owners, are treating their workers properly. They shouldn’t face an uneven playing field because of those doing the wrong thing.
